# What is the Azure CLI?

The Azure Command-Line-Interfact (CLI) is a cross-platform command-line tool to connect to Azure
and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It allows the execution of commands through
a terminal using interactive command-line prompts or a script

# Subscription syntax example

The Azure CLI syntax follows a simple `reference name` - `command` - `parameter` - `parameter value`
pattern.

For example switching between subscription is often a command task:

Here is the [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli)

````Azure CLI
az account set --subscription "my subscription name"
````
