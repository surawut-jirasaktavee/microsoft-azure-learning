## What is Azure Data Factory?

On this day on big data we have a lot of type of data:
- Raw data
- Organized data
- Unorganized data

Which ofthen stored in relational, non-relational and other storage systems. raw data doesn't have
-the proper context or meaning to provide meaningful insights to:
- Data analysts
- Data scientists
- Business decision makers

Big data requires a service that can orchestrate and operationalize processes to refine these enormouse
-stores of raw data into actionable business insights. Azure Data Factory is managed cloud service that's
built for these complex hybrid extract-transform-load(ETL), extract-load-transform(ELT), and data integration projects.

## How does it work?

Data Factory contains a series of interconnected systems that provide a complete end-to-end platform for
data engineers.
